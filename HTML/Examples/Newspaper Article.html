            <p width="100%" style = "font-family: Arial; font-size: 18px;">21-year-old Syam Kumar S.S., a leg amputee since age 8, confronted a troubling thought. “I told myself, ‘I have already suffered a lot in life. It is enough,’”he recalls. And then he had another thought―“What if I jump from a height?”
            <br><br>
            Kumar, now 23, has acheived two records in the International Book of Records. A resident of Thiruvananthapuram’s Kulathummal village, he is the youngest person in the world to skydive solo from an altitude of 13,000ft with a prosthetic leg and the youngest paragliding pilot with a prosthetic leg.
            <br><br>
            Following the wind tunnel training, Kumar travelled to Thailand for his inaugural jump in November 2023.
            <br><br>
            Prior to that, he had to clear a written exam for USPA licence. Additionally, he underwent canopy training and other necessary preparations. When the time came for his first jump, his instructor asked whether he preferred to jump solo or with him.

            <p width="100%" style = "font-family: Arial; font-size: 18px;">
            Kumar controlled his free fall with the prosthetic limb in the first two jumps safely. But during his third jump, he started experiencing a dangerous spin. “And, when I opened the parachute, it tangled with my leg. Luckily, it was my normal leg, and I managed to untangle the canopy and land safely within a gap of 12 seconds. The instructor then suggested I do more wind tunnel sessions.”
            <br><br>
            The Thai Police facilitated his wind tunnel training. Following this, Kumar successfully completed three more skydives. During these jumps, he encountered challenges such as unexpected winds, but his quick thinking enabled him to land safely.
            <br><br>
            However, after these experiences, skydiving instructors informed Kumar that he could no longer skydive with his prosthetic leg because of control issues, particularly as advanced jumps require precise airborne manoeuvres. They advised him to learn to jump without his prosthetic leg. “It is like imagining an airplane flying with one wing,”he said.</p>
